                 <span class="item-content">Miltios came up with the idea for this site after realizing he hates math and would have to recalculate accuracy/alacrity balancing every time new gear came out.  He is a web developer by day, juggernaut tank by night, and dazzlingly handsome male model between the hours of 6:30 and 7:45 on days that do not end with "y".  He raids with &lt;Your Companion&gt; on the Star Forge server and has written a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1452i96vSKt-JctyjLkEia8EDooQJ5OZrY3_pqMjyzNE/edit">guide on jugg tanking</a>, which he occasionally bothers to keep up to date.</span>

                    <span class="item-content">Zasmi is the lead designer, tester, child emperor, CGO (Chief Greebling Officer) and, owing to her background in architecture and design, the primary reason why this website doesn't look like it was made in MS Paint. She is also the first Jawa to ever take up a sniper rifle and fight for the good of the Empire&mdash;a skill that she puts to use weekly with &lt;Your Companion&gt;. Not to be confused with Blizz.</span>

                    <span class="item-content">TORCommunity's database is by far the most convenient source of info &amp; stats for pre-252 items, without which building this site would be an enormous pain and we would've given up ages ago.</span>
                    <span class="item-title"><a href="https://swtor.jedipedia.net/en">Jedipedia</a></span>
                    <span class="item-content">Jedipedia is the go-to source for datamined content, including PTS item stats and images.  Much like above, we owe them a great deal of our sanity for their hard work.</span>

                    <span class="item-content">Rambol has the definitive in-depth guide on stats & damage calculation, a.k.a. They Did The Math.  Most of the stat algorithms on this site are derived from their work and cross-checked with in-game values.</span>

                    <span class="item-content">Both founders have been raiding with YC since we were story-mode heroes, and we got to where we are today thanks largely to their <span class="strikethrough">guidance, patience, and</span> repair funds.  YC runs a HM training operation every thursday, and welcomes anyone who is interested in learning (or teaching) intermediate-level raids.</span>

                  <span class="item-content">Glow, Veti, and Z all helped with the first round of beta testing, and with discussion of high-level gearing meta in general.</span>
