            <div class="faq-question">Is this site like Ask Mr. Robot?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">It's not based on AMR (we didn't find out about them until our site was basically done), but it seems to fill roughly the same niche for SWTOR.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Are you going to add [feature]?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Maybe!  Everything depends on how much time we have, how difficult the feature is, and how many people ask for it.  Feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> if you want your voice heard.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">How can I help?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Tell other SWTOR players about the site, and tell other gamers about SWTOR!  Beyond that, if you are a java/javascript developer and you think you know how to implement some new features, feel free to drop us a line (we may update this question later to list commonly-requested items that we don't have time to tackle ourselves).</div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Shut up and take my money!</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">First of all, that's not a question.  Second, we are not currently accepting donations, but as long as you have your wallet out, go ahead and send some money to these worthwhile causes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Electronic Frontier Foundation</li>
                    <li><!--TODO:Other charities?--></li>
                </ul>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">I'm getting a warning for my gear, but I don't think I'm doing anything wrong.  What gives?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">The grey warnings are just there to remind you of things you may want to check; the One True Optimal Build may depend on your class/build/playstyle, or even what fight you're preparing for.  The yellow and red warnings, though, mean that we're pretty sure you messed up.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Is having Absorb higher than Shield really a bad thing?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Depends.  The underlying rule is this: having equal Shield/Absorb gives you the maximum <i>overall</i> mitigation, while having Shield higher than Absorb gives you the most <i>consistent</i> mitigation, and having Absorb higher than Shield gives you a spiky, unpredictable mess.  The catch is that some abilities give an extra boost in combat that's not reflected here or on your character screen&mdash;for example, Sin tanks' Dark Ward gives a large boost to Shield, which gradually adds a bonus to Absorb as you get hit, and then back to just Shield when you refresh Dark Ward.  All of this should impact how you build your raw stats; the grey warnings are just there to remind you of things you may want to check.</div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">I'm a tank.  Why do Lethal mods show up when I filter for "my spec"?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">BioWare made some...interesting moves when calculating how Defense works.  The bottom line is that Warding mods sometimes result in wasted stat distribution, and you may be better off mods that were originally designed for DPS&mdash;this won't make you any tankier, but it will help you kill the stuff that's trying to kill you.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">So what <i>is</i> the meta for tank Defense, anyway?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">That's open for debate.  Here is the graph for Defense, courtesy of <a href="https://www.rambol.net/home/2018/3/13/stats-and-damage-calculation-in-swtor#defence_rating">Rambol.net</a>:
                <img src="/images/faq/rambol_defense_graph.png" />
                All stats get diminishing returns like this, but for Defense, the amount you get <i>just from the default gear</i> is so high that it pushes you into "why even bother" territory.  Most raiders recommend capping yourself somewhere between 2-3k Defense, and spending the rest on DPS stats like Power instead.

            <div class="faq-question">Is the Reactive Warding relic still bugged?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Last time we checked (5.0), yes.  If you have hard evidence that this is (or isn't) fixed, we'd love to know.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">What is this 306-rating gear and how do I get it?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">We got this info from the PTS to help anticipate what gearing will be like in 6.0.  You can't get it in-game yet, and there may be slight changes when it actually arrives.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">What's up with the weird "T6" item names?  I don't see anything like this in-game.</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">The new Tier 6 gear from 6.0 has a ton of different names based on what set bonus it gives.  From our site's perspective, there is no need to distinguish between the Edgelord Of Pain Greaves and the Sage's Sexy Stockings because they both give the same stats, so we made up generic tank/DPS/healer gear to represent all of the options.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Why don't you have tacticals, amplifiers, or any of the 6.0 set bonuses?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Because none of those affect your actual stats.  We recommend planning out your stat gear first, and then using whatever in-game tactical/amplifiers/set bonuses suit your play style.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">I found a bug!</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Cool, <a href="contact.html">let us know</a>.</div>
