            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleExpand(this)">Is this site like Ask Mr. Robot?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">It's not based on AMR (we didn't find out about them until our site was basically done), but it seems to fill roughly the same niche for SWTOR.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item faq-item-collapsed">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleExpand(this)">Are you going to add [feature]?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Maybe!  Everything depends on how much time we have, how difficult the feature is, and how many people ask for it.  Feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> if you want your voice heard.</div>

        <div class="faq-item faq-item-collapsed">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleExpand(this)">How can I help?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Tell other SWTOR players about the site, and tell other gamers about SWTOR!  Beyond that, if you are a java/javascript developer and you think you know how to implement some new features, feel free to drop us a line (we may update this question later to list commonly-requested items that we don't have time to tackle ourselves).</div>

            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleExpand(this)">Shut up and take my money!</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">First of all, that's not a question.  Second, we are not currently accepting donations, but as long as you have your wallet out, go ahead and send some money to these worthwhile causes:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://ablegamers.org/">AbleGamers</a> helps fellow gamers with disabilities by giving them custom gaming setups with special assistive technology, so they can have fun too.</li>
                    <li>The <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> is a nonprofit dedicated to defending civil liberties in the digital realm, from Net Neutrality to Fair Use.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://watermission.org/">Water Mission</a> builds safe water, sanitation, and hygiene solutions internationally in the places that need it most.</li>
                </ul>

        <div class="faq-item faq-item-collapsed">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleExpand(this)">I'm getting a warning for my gear, but I don't think I'm doing anything wrong.  What gives?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">The grey warnings are just there to remind you of things you may want to check; the One True Optimal Build may depend on your class/build/playstyle, or even what fight you're preparing for.  The yellow and red warnings, though, mean that we're pretty sure you messed up.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item faq-item-collapsed">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleExpand(this)">Is having Absorb higher than Shield really a bad thing?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Depends.  The underlying rule is this: having equal Shield/Absorb gives you the maximum <i>overall</i> mitigation, while having Shield higher than Absorb gives you the most <i>consistent</i> mitigation, and having Absorb higher than Shield gives you a spiky, unpredictable mess.  The catch is that some abilities give an extra boost in combat that's not reflected here or on your character screen&mdash;for example, Assassin tanks' Dark Ward gives a large boost to Shield, which gradually adds a bonus to Absorb as you get hit, and then back to just Shield when you refresh Dark Ward.  All of this should impact how you build your raw stats; the grey warnings are just there to remind you of things you may want to check.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item faq-item-collapsed">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleExpand(this)">I'm a tank.  Why do Lethal mods show up when I filter for "my spec"?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">BioWare made some...interesting moves when calculating how Defense works.  The bottom line is that Warding mods sometimes result in wasted stat distribution, and you may be better off mods that were originally designed for DPS&mdash;this won't make you any tankier, but it will help you kill the stuff that's trying to kill you.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item faq-item-collapsed">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleExpand(this)">So what <i>is</i> the meta for tank Defense, anyway?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">That's open for debate.  Here is the graph for Defense, courtesy of <a href="https://www.rambol.net/home/2018/3/13/stats-and-damage-calculation-in-swtor#defence_rating">Rambol.net</a> (numbers are from 5.x but the meaning still applies):
                <img src="/images/faq/rambol_defense_graph.png" />
                All stats get diminishing returns like this, but for Defense, the amount you get <i>just from the default gear</i> is so high that it pushes you into "why even bother" territory.  Most raiders recommend capping yourself somewhere between 2-3k Defense, and spending the rest on DPS stats like Power instead.

            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleExpand(this)">Is the Reactive Warding relic still bugged?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Last time we checked (5.0), yes.  If you have hard evidence that this is (or isn't) fixed, we'd love to know.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item faq-item-collapsed">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleExpand(this)">What is this 306-rating gear and how do I get it?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">We got this info from the PTS to help anticipate what gearing will be like in 6.0.  You can't get it in-game yet, and there may be slight changes when it actually arrives.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item faq-item-collapsed">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleExpand(this)">Why don't you have tacticals and amplifiers?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Because neither of those affect your actual stats.  We recommend planning out your stat gear first, and then using whatever in-game tactical and amplifiers suit your play style.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item faq-item-collapsed">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleExpand(this)">I play Republic, and all the set bonuses have Imperial ability names.</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">We're planning to fix this later, bear with us!  It wasn't possible to do this ahead of time on the PTS because everything was still in flux.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item faq-item-collapsed">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleExpand(this)">I got a mod with a bunch of letters and numbers at the end, and I don't see it on your site.</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Lots of mods have about a dozen or so variants like "Bastion Enhancement 75R-12" with slightly different stats.  We do not have the staff (or patience) to track every single one of these, so we provide the base versions ("Bastion Enhancement 75") and give you the option to input different stats to match what you actually have in-game.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item faq-item-collapsed">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleExpand(this)">Does this site work for characters below level 75?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">No.  All of the stat calculations are different when you're below max level, and the gear you get is entirely different anyway.  We recommend getting up to the level cap before worrying about your gear too much.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item faq-item-collapsed">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleExpand(this)">All of my stats look different from what I see here.</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">You're probably not max level yet; see above.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item faq-item-collapsed">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleExpand(this)">I found a bug!</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Cool, <a href="contact.html">let us know</a>.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item faq-item-collapsed">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleExpand(this)">I found a bug, and I use Internet Explorer!</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Internet Explorer <i>is</i> a bug.  Go away.</div>
